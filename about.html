        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I grew up in a small New Hampshire town. When I was young I took apart all of my toys to see how they worked. Around middle school I learned to weld and was given free reign of my dad's shop full of tools. My younger brother and I would weld creations out of old bikes and scrap steel to ride around. Once I built a pneumatic cannon that shot a rake so far into the sky we never actually saw it come down. After high school I attended the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth where I received a B.S. in mechanical engineering. I enjoy climbing and hiking mountains, studying languages and exploring other countries. I love building things.</p>
